ABOUT ME
--------------------

- Languages: Vietnames and English.
- Hobbies: Movies and Dota.
- 100% self-learner.


Technical Experience
--------------------

**Javascript:** My favorite and first-choice language since 2012.

- Efficient and familiar with javascript hypes including but not limited to `ES6`, `Typescript`, `Gulp`, `Cordova` and `RegEx`. 
- I can can regularly design my own build scripts with `Gulp`. My favorite transpiler is `Browserify`.
- Current frameworks & libraries of choice: `React`, `Redux`, `Phaser.js`, `lodash`, `Angular.js`, `Ionic`.
- Occasionally design my own frameworks or development tools as hobbies or of neccessary.
- Prefer functional programing whenever possible.

**Unity3D:** Good game engine. Familiar but not my first choice of work, since 2015.

- My experience cover a few games including the revamped multiplayer version of Sword of Vendetta and the Hanoi GGJ winner Night of Shame.
- This provides me with knowledges of `C#` that helps me work easier with `Typescript`.

**Java:** Had 1 or 2 years working with the language before covering mathematics programing and Android development. No longer willing to touch it again.

Basic knowledge: **C**, **Python**, **Lua**.
