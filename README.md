ABOUT ME
--------------------

- Languages: Vietnames and English.
- Hobbies: Movies and Dota.
- 100% self-learner.


SKILLS
--------------------

**Javascript:** My favorite and first-choice language since 2012.
 
- I can and do regularly design my own build scripts.
- Frameworks & libraries of choice: `React`, `Phaser.js`, `lodash`, `Ionic2`.
- Occasionally design my own frameworks or development tools as hobbies or of neccessity.

**Unity3D:**

- My experiences cover a few games including the revamped multiplayer version of Sword of Vendetta, the Hanoi GGJ winner Night of Shame.
- Occasionally design my own libraries as hobbies. Eg. a library for deserializing JSON for Unit3D C#.

**Audio**: 

- While I do not do audio editting, I have good sense of sound designing and can help people produce a good voice acting performance. Check out **Night of Shame** to see for yourself.
